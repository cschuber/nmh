# for the use of the buildbot cluster, allowing developers to see the
# build environment on machines they can't login on.  It also provides
# a history in the build logs that might be useful in catching
# regressions.

# This script should *only* report basic information about the build
# environment, and only that necessary to reproduce the build
# environment.
#
# The script's exit status must be zero if all went acceptably well as
# buildbot checks for this and marks the `environment' stage as failed
# otherwise.
