    Date: 3 Feb 1981 15:57:05-PST
    From: CSVAX.kas at Berkeley
    Message-ID: <601.350091987@CSVAX.Berkeley>
    To: Day@Rand-Unix, Urban@Rand-Unix
    Subject: Re: Updated MH to run in 4bsd environment
    In-reply-to: Your message of 27 Jan 1981 2011-PST (Tuesday).
    Fcc: mh

    I have finished making the new version of MH run in our 4bsd
    environment.  That is, our version of MH runs compatibly with
    the standard v7 mail program, the Berkeley Mail, UNIX sndmsg, msg,
    and others.  Some of the things I encountered may be of use to
    you in making your distribution of MH easier to install in 4bsd systems.

    So here they are:

    ali.c           Changed to use a #define for the MailAlias file.
		    Should really have created a new strings file for it.

    annotate.c      Now uses the character defined by CBACKUP instead of ,
		    for the backup convention.  We have a line of the form:

		    40 4 * * * find / -name '#*' -atime +3 -exec rm -f {} \;

		    in /usr/lib/crontab and it seemed easier to make MH
		    obey that than to convince users to use ,

    conflict.c      Used to reference ``struct dir'' which in our system at
		    least is defined in /usr/include/sys/dir.h as
		    ``struct direct''

    dist.c          Changed to use CBACKUP, instead of comma

    folder.c        Removed fflush(stdout) after each line of output.  This makes
                    the program appear to run faster.

    forw.c          Changed to use CBACKUP, not comma

    inc.c           Changed to call a program unixtomh (described later) which
		    reads mail in standard unix format and converts it to MH
		    format.  Now has -file filename flag to read messages
		    from a file (many users already have mbox files full of
                    unix format mail. they can do inc -file mbox +mbox to
                    convert this to an MH folder).  Also has -keep to
                    prefer close(creat(mailboxname, 0600)) to unlink to
                    help users preserve a non-publically readable mode on
                    their mail drop.

    mail.c          Renamed mhmail.c to avoid confusion

    mhl.c           Changed to use termlib to clear terminal screen correctly.
		    Fixed its argument processing so it won't try to open flag
		    arguments as files.

    news.c          s/struct dir/struct direct/

    rmf.c           Uses CBACKUP instead of comma

    rmm.c           Uses CBACKUP instead of comma

    scan.c          Has -reverse flag to look at headers newest first.  A user
		    with a HUGE inbox demanded this.

    send.c          Uses CBACKUP instead of comma

    unixtomh.c      Created program to read unix format mail and put it in MH
		    format.  This is invoked by inc.

    mh.h            Although this is the wrong place to do it, added CBACKUP
		    #define to give backup character.  Should really be in
		    strings.

    mailsys.h       Changed path names to end with / to satisfy the assumption
		    in inc.c that they look that way.

    deliver.c       Now makes temporary file in /tmp, not /usr/tmp/mh,
		    doesn't check validity of network addressees,
		    Only outputs From: and Date: in fcc copy of message,
		    invokes /etc/delivermail on all recipients to actually
		    deliver the mail, removed putdate() routine in favor
		    of shared (with unixtomh) version in subs, and now
		    uses #define MAILALIASES.

    Also, a couple of minor notes:  we do not have a strings.h file in
    /usr/include, which I assume gave the return types of routines like
    rindex() and friends.  A number of files include system files as, eg:

    #include <types.h>
    #include <stat.h>

    this requires that you give the preprocessor flag -I/usr/include/sys
    for it to be found.  This creates problems for the make depend stuff
    since include files are not necessarily in /usr/include.  I got around
    this by simply editing out the header file dependencies from the
    Makefiles.

    Finally, to get around the conflict between /usr/bin/file and the MH file
    command, I made a program fakefile which examines its arguments.  If any
    begin with +, it invokes MH file, else /usr/bin/file.  This seems to
    work fine.

    I have everything sccs'd so I can send you sccs source, diffs, new source
    or whatever if you like.

2/26/81 Dave Clemans, SDC

        Because the ISC system is a UNIX V6 variant, and MH is set up for
        V7, there are a few differences:

	Because of name conflicts between MH programs and ISC programs,
		mail
		news
		file
        are in the directory /misc/bin.  The version of file in /misc/bin
        is a preprocessor; if its argument list has an argument with a '+'
        as its first character, it calls /usr/bin/file.msg, otherwise it
        calls /bin/file.

        MH wants to look at a few environment variables, which don't exist
        on UNIX V6.  They are simulated using the global shell variables of
        the SDC-extended "Harvard" shell.  For people who use the "Harvard"
        shell (hsh), this procedure is handled automatically.  For people
        who use the Berkeley C shell (csh) or people who use the ISC shell,
        a special command has to be run at least once, and possible every
        time that you log in, depending on how often you change things.
        What follows is a short description of that command:

	     /misc/bin/mhsetup <login  name>  <home  directory>  <search path>

							  Environment Variable
		<login name> is your actual login name          USER
		<home directory> is your login directory        HOME
		<search path> is the PWB/UNIX style path        PATH

        There also has been a few extensions made to MH at SDC.  A short
        list of these are:

        a.  Registered mail: send has a -register and a -noregister switch.
           A receipt is sent back to the sending user when the receiving
           user types "inc" and a registered message is received. (Done by
           adding a "Registered" component to the message)

        b.  Fcc:  Multiple folder names are accepted in this component and
           handled correctly.

        c.  Personal mailing lists:  In addition to the mailing lists
           accepted by the /etc/MailAliases file, users can maintain
           private mailing lists.  These are referenced by addresses of the
           form "<path", where path is the name of the mailing list.  It is
           looked for first in the current directory, and then in the users
           Mail directory.  It should have the same format as a list of
           addresses typed in by hand.

        d.  Automatic forwarding:  If a user has accounts on multiple
           machines, but only uses one of them on a regular basis, it is
           possible to have all messages from those other machines
           automatically forwarded to the machine that is used regularly.
           The same database hook used by this is also used to provide full
           names in addresses:
		(i.e., Full Name <user at host>)
	   (Done by having a file with one line for each user, of the format:
		<user>  <flag>  <address>       :<Full Name>
	   <user> is the local user name
	   <flag> says whether or not to forward
	   <address> is the forwarding address
	   <Full Name> is the users full name)

        e.  Msg/Sndmsg:  There are msg/sndmsg programs in /misc/bin that
           look very similar to normal ARPAnet msg/sndmsg programs, but
           which interface to MH.

        f.  Repl: repl has "-fccme" and "-nofccme" switches for making file
           copies of replies to messages.

        g.  Next/Prev: next and prev have "-pr" and "-nopr" switches.  They
           have the same effect as the "-pr" and "-nopr" switches in show.

	The "onstruct is recognized and handled correctly.  The only
	transport mechanism available currently is the Berkeley network (from
	2BSD).
	(Hooks do exist to add others, specifically UUCP).  Currently defined
	host names are:
		sdc-70          the R&D 11/70 system
		sdc-net         the 11/45 network support machine

	Two other host names exist for sending mail into the ISC mail system.
	These are "sdc-70x" and "local".

	For any problems, or for more information, send a message to dgc
	dgc

        Or at least it should be something I can opt for with an entry in
        .mh_profile.

	commands.

11/24/81
	SUBJECT: An mh argument to specify the profile file
	From: norm at RAND-UNIX

        What the world needs is for every mh command to have an optional
        flag, say "-profile", which introduces an alternative file to be
        used, for all purposes, instead of .mh_profile.

        This capability has a number of obvious and less obvious
        consequences that would make mh a much more powerful system and
        seems to have little adverse impact when not used.


1/24/82
	Subject: mail aliases and automatic forwarding

	MH should provide facilities for a user to
	forward/unforward his mail somewhere easily.
	This does NOT mean telling him that all he has
	to do is write a shell procedure and install it
	in his .mh_receive file.  The MH command I am
	proposing would do that for you, and do the
	appropriate locking against race conditions.
	You need to be able to divert your incoming mail,
	and to set up other aliases to your login name--
	in this case, the command should send a message
	to a system administrator requresting the alias.

	Bell mail allows a user to write, for example,
		Forward to harpo!ber
	in the beginning of your mail spool file to
	forward mail.  (Brian also points out that that is
	also the ONLY aliasing that they provide.)
	I don't think this is such a good idea, since
	it requires knowledge of where the mail spool file is,
	and is susceptible to a race condition if incoming mail
	comes in while you are messing with the spool
