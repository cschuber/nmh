	If .mh_profile contains an entry like "show: -pr -a -b -c" and you
	call "show" with the explicit switch -nopr, then you have those
	dangling -a -b -c switches that were intended for pr.
	(Bound the switch list for pr, etc., with a semi-colon?)

	"file +junk" makes junk a folder, while "file +.junk" makes ".junk"

	When repl gets an adrparse error, it should return to
	"What now?" instead of aborting. (But see objections in
	/r/phyl/Mail/MH/16)

	The same goes for comp, dist, forw

	When send is invoked with no args, and the draft already
        exists, options to "use draft?" should include "list" along with

	inc -nochangecur displays that the first-inc'ed message is the current

        Re:Log:"3/23/81 jdg/day: changed deliver.c to check for effective
        uid and gid while it is preventing forgery of mail.  Needed for
        uucp, when uucico is invoked by a real person instead of uucp
        itself."

        The real fix should be to check for real uid==0 (srvrftp) or real
        gid==daemon (any uu program) or effective gid==daemon (human
        running uucico, and uucico should be SGID daemon).

	/usr/tmp/mh files are readable by the world.
	So are /usr/spool/uucp files.

	A message should not have to exist for you to be able to use

	Deliver should run one uux per site instead of one per addressee.

6/2/81
	"rmf" should automatically remove .e* files from the named folder.

	deliver fails to recognize "at" when it is preceded by
	     more than one blank.

	repl tries to parse a Sender [or From] field, and a To
	     field, without first testing for their existence.

	file protections on rmail/uucico are inconsistent with
	     deliver's internal user/group tests.

	deliver fails to recognize that localhost!user is indeed user.
	     (Should it?)

	temporary mail files stay around when the "no such local user"
	     error occurs--because of a spurious flag test.

	deliver should parenthesize (user at host) as well as (host!user)
	     when constructing the uux command.

	rmail should direct stderr to a file before invoking deliver.

	rmail should check for unknown local user and send return mail to the
	     originator. (Can't fix unless no intervening Arpanet addresses.)

	rmail should add a Date: component if there is none.

	mail headers should be reordered.

7/23/81
	"mail" should be in /bin, not in /usr/randbin. (?)

	Subject: news bug
	From: phyl at RAND-UNIX

	The table of news topics overflowed.

        news.c counts all non-dot files in the directory /usr/news to
        determine the number of news topics.  But mail sent to an UNKNOWN
        news topic remains in the top level news directory, erroneously
        getting counted into the total.  Either .mh-receive should stow
        undeliverable news into another directory, or news.c should count
        only directory entries.

	Subject: Mail to "everyone"
	From: obrien at RAND-UNIX

                An insoluble problem: sending mail to "everyone" (a risky
        business at best) generates mail to every line in /etc/passwd,
        including those like "uucp", "unix32v", and such which aren't real
        people.  An exception list is no help because it gets out of date.
        Only cure I know of is to go through /usr/spool/mail every now and
        again and get rid of phony files.

	Subject: HOSTNUM not necessary
	From: greep at SU-DSN

        Mh deliver should really not need HOSTNUM (this is in
         /usr/include/whoami.h) - it can get the number by searching for
         HOSTNAME in the host table.

	Message lists should not be reordered.  (Norm, Phyl)

12/17/81
	The alias function doesn't work when a single message contains
	multiple instances of the address form "foo.*"--ergo, a message
	cannot be sent to more than one news group.

	Note that /usr/news/.mh_receive won't recognize multiple news
	groups in a single message either!

12/19/81
	If a message is addressed to more than one local alias-group,
	people who are in more than one of the groups receive multiple
	copies of the message. (I think! --phyl--)

1/5/82
	If you send a message to a bad uucp host name, it a) gives you
	an error message, b) queues the mail anyway, and c) deletes the
	draft because the mail was "correctly sent".  Ha!
	It should a) give you an error message and b) punt.

1/19/82

	MH argument parsing should be upgraded to allow
	folder arguments to have a space between the +
	and the folder name so you can use shell matching
	syntax.  Example:

	   % folder + /usr/news/net-g*
	   % cd !$

	deliver should clean up before exiting.
