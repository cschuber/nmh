2/16/81 progs Dave Yost:
	Fixed folder so that it checks value from m_gmsg and complains
	if the folder is unreadable.  All other commands that call it
	do this, so it was simply an error of omission.

2/16/81 subs Dave Yost:
	m_gmsg.c was testing return value of malloc against -1.
	Tsk.

2/16/81 subs Phyllis Kantar
	trimcpy.c was scanning profile fields from the left and
	truncating ('\0') at the first newline.  It now zaps
	the trailing newline and replaces embedded NL's with blanks.

2/23/81 progs phyl:
	Fixed annotation so that it annotates only "To:" and "cc:"
	    In forw.c  doano():
		    Changed
			    if(uleq(name, "to") || uleq(name, "cc") == 0) {
		    to:
			    if(uleq(name, "to") || uleq(name, "cc") ) {

	Similarly for dist.c
	Changed /etc/mh/distcomps to read "Distribute*"
		instead of "Distribution*"

	Also, fixed bug in annotate.c:
		fprintf(tmp, "%s: %*s", comp, cp-sp, sp);
			should be
		fprintf(tmp, "%s: %*.*s", comp, cp-sp, cp-sp, sp);

	Note: none of these fixes affects repl



3/23/81 progs jdg/day:  changed deliver.c to check for effective uid and gid
	while it is preventing forgery of mail.  Needed for uucp, when
	uucico is invoked by a real person instead of uucp itself.

4/7/81  progs Dave-Yost
	Fixed scansub.c to check for HOSTNAME instead of "rand-unix".
	A little portability, please.

4/13/81 progs  Dave-Yost
	Changed deliver to put out a date format like
	  Monday, 13 Apr 1981 20:46-PST
	instead of
	  13 Apr 1981 at 2046-PST

4/13/81 subs Dave Yost
	modified m_edit.c to exec the editor with altmsg as an extra
	argument, in case the editor can use it as an alt file.

5/7/81  progs Dave-Yost
	Changed conflict.c and conflict.8 to ignore /usr/spool/mail
	files starting with '.'.

5/7/81  progs Dave-Yost
	conflict isn't smart about the fact that there can be
	more than one login name on the same uid.  This should
	be fixed.

5/29/81 progs Phyl
	Changed /usr/news/.mh_receive to grep for

		'^[Tt][Oo]:.*news\.'

	instead of

		'[Tt][Oo]:'

	However, 'news' will still break when there are multiple news folders
        in the 'To:' field(s)!

7/2/81  progs Phyl:
	Changed inc.c and scansub.c so that mail is not lost when
		the message number exceeds 999.

7/2/81  progs day:
	mh.h has #define MAXFOLDER 999 and hopefully all occurrences
	of that magic number have been changed to MAXFOLDER.

7/2/81  progs day:
        Fixed pick and file so they won't go beyond 999 (MAXFOLDER)
	into a folder.  file.c and pick.c had virtually identical
        copies of the same routine to file a message.  Took it out and
	put it into subs as m_file(), and changed it to have
        several arguments so there are no connections via globals.
        Also created ../folder.h which is included by pick.c, file.c,
        and ../subs/m_file.c.

7/2/81  progs day:
	Changed the message-name parser (../subs/m_convert.c) to
	limit message number arguments to 999 (MAXFOLDER).  Thus if you
	say 'scan 800-10000', this will be interpreted as 'scan 800-999'

7/2/81  progs day:
	Some very minor changes to satisfy lint.

7/6/81  progs day:
	Did a make install of all the stuff changed in the last
	few days.

7/9/81  progs phyl:
	fixed inc so that "inc -nochangecur" doesn't display a spurious '+'
	on the 1st incorporated msg.

7/24/81 progs  phyl:

        Fixed rmail to match graphics.  On the Vax, it failed to construct
        a From: field when the next hop is Arpanet if there was a remote
	uucp hop remaining.

8/10/81 progs phyl:

	Fixed rmail to block uucp-to-arpanet mail when the originating
	host is not a Rand sysname.  It also returns mail to the sender
	when this condition occurs.

	rmail now recognizes "at" as well as "@".

	rmail no longer compares headers against a list of legal headers;
	rather it tests for proper form "<63-chars-or-less>:"

	m_getfld.c now tests for ':' BEFORE it tests for header length
	exceeded.

8/10/81 progs strings day:

	remove hostname.c from mh/strings.a.  It was used only by
	deliver.c for constructing a msgid;  now it uses
	HOSTNAME (from <whoami.h>)

8/10/81 Dave Yost
	Put rhosts[] decl in mh.h and added rhosts.c to strings.a
	rmail is only thing that references it just now.

8/11/81 Dave Yost
	Added rand proprietary notice to all .c, .h, and Makefiles.
	Ownership and date on all files left unchanged.

8/11/81 Dave Yost
	Combined */Log into this file

8/13/81 Phyl
	Added uucp addresses to deliver's debug printout.
	(Didn't install).

8/18/81 Phyl
	Fixed adrparse so that it accepts multiple "at"s in an address:
	a!b!c at d at e at f  ==> (a!b!c at d at e) at f

	Changed deliver to set a new process group when it is called
        with the -deliver switch--so that if it sends an interrupt to pid
        0, it's parent (e.g., srvrftp) won't get blown away.
	Note that deliver now must be loaded with the jobs library (-ljobs),
	to access setpgrp().  I added "#define VMUNIX" to mh.h,
	and #ifdef'd the call to setpgrp.

	Fixed deliver to allow 120 secs (instead of only 30)
	for a user's .mh_receive to complete.

8/26/81 Mike
	Fixed "folder" so you can now have up to 300 folders.

9/24/81 phyl
	fixed scansub.c to incorporate illegal messages correctly:
		Bug: If the bad message has the bobo in its last line,
			then inc says [No mail incorporated]
		FIX: if (state == BODYEOF || state == FILEEOF)
					  -------------------
		Bug: spurious chars printed in the body of the bad msg.
		FIX:    a) \n after the bad component
			b) if(scnout && state != FILEEOF)
				     -------------------

10/1/81 phyl
	fixed mhl bug;  it no longer bombs on "mhl: -option " profile
	arguments:
		procargs(ap);           /* Old */
		procargs(profargs);     /* New */

10/13/81 obrien
	changed scansub to replace '\f' with blank

11/4/81 day
	Fixed pick to say '1 hit' instead of `1 hits'.

11/18/81  phyl
        Accidently did a "make" in /usr/src/cmd/mh on Nov 18.  Most
        programs reloaded because the new "#define VMUNIX" in mh.h caused
        strings.a to be remade.  Did not install any of it. err file moved
        to err.Nov18

1/6/82    phyl
	o Added scansub dependencies to Makefile
	o Added rmail.c and scansub.c to CFILES in Makefile
	o Alphabetized  dependency list in Makefile
	o ??Are all the Nov 18 binaries suspect?  The Aug 18 .o files?
	o I ask because--
	   Nov 18 prompter had strange behavior (didn't respond to <DEL>,
	   didn't display error messages) which disappeared when
           recompiled.

1/7/82  phyl
	o Added cs-rand to rhosts.c.
	o Re-make all of MH (save old .o files in DOT.o.01072;
			     save old executables in SAVE.01072)

1/20/82  phyl
	Fixed scansub.c to terminate a short message body with ">>"
	on the scan line.

1/25/82  phyl
	Changed deliver.c, repl.c, send.c to require all 5 characters
	for -debug switch.

	(didn't "make")

2/19/82  phyl
	mh.h: added SELECT_EMPTY flag

2/22/82 day
	mh.h change char to extern char for strings in strings/strings.a
	progs: install my new inc, scan, and scansub with -time and -numdate
	progs: change show.c so it includes mhl.c and calls it if
	showproc is mhl, rather than execing it.

3/10/82  phyl
	Changed adrparse to return 0 in case of error, instead of exiting.
	Changed repl to test for adrparse's return value and do the
                right thing.  It constructs a reply skeleton, omitting the
                offending addresses from the header.  Instead, unparsable
                addresses are listed in the skeleton body.  Note, repl
		normally takes the sender:'s (or from:'s) host as the default
		to append to hostless addressees.  In the new version,
		if the sender (or from) field was unparsable, the default
		host is "?????".
	Changed deliver to test for adrparse's 0 return value, and exit.

4/22/82  phyl
	Changed the functions msg_convert() and msg_conv() to convert()
	and conv(), respectively, to maintain 8-char uniqueness.
	Linked new source into /usr/dist/1.7

4/23/82 phyl
	scansub.c: renamed the structure tag 'zone' to 'tzone'
	for compatibility with lesser C compilers (?). (Anyway,
	it wouldn't load on the 11/45 under 2.8bsd without that change.)
	Delete unused reference to locv().
	Linked new source into /usr/dist/1.7

5/8/82 phyl, guyton
	scansub.c: no longer reads the full message when called
	by scan.
	Linked new source into /usr/dist/1.7

5/8/82 phyl
	rmail: now tacks on Arpa-style date to dateless uucp mail.
	Takes date from oldest uucp-From line.  Assumes uudate is
	in ctime() format.

5/10/82 phyl
        Fixed bug in deliver that caused mail addresses uuhost1!joe,
        uuhost2!joe to look like duplicates.  Fix: if uuaddress, compare
        host names instead of host numbers.

5/12/82
	Fixed news.

	    Until now it couldn't handle "cc: news.topic", or "To: news.topicA,
	    news.topicB", or news topics that aren't explicitly in the message
	    header, or ...).

	    Deliver: fixed it so that aliasing keeps a handle on the
	    1st (local) alias.  Now deliver can pass this string to
	    /usr/news/.mh_receive as an argument, rather than have .mh_receive
	    grep through the message for the news topic.
	    Deliver: changed aliasing so that, once it finds a match to an
	    alias whose form is <string>*, it *continues* comparing addresses.

	Deliver: changed it to fflush(stdout) after every printf() sans '\n'.

6/3/82 phyl
	All references to anoyes were changed from char *
	to extern struct swit.

	mh.h: delete hostname, layout;  add mailproc; change mypath
	from extern char * to char *.

	progs/Makefile:  move "chmod 777 MHTMP" down to installroot.

	Deliver: a bug that caused the temp files in /usr/tmp/mh
	to hang around whenever there was a local delivery error
	was fixed.

		if(!debug && rmflg > 1)  ==>  if(!debug && rmflg > 0)

	m_gmsg.c:  WAS FIXED TO USE FREAD INSTEAD OF READ on the mail
	dir
