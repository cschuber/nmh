Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- The default editor has been changed from 'vi' to 'prompter', to align with
  historical practice and reduce packaging dependencies on external programs.
- A new -checkbase64 switch to mhfixmsg(1).
- inc(1)/msgchk(1) now support STARTTLS for the POP protocol.
- All TLS-supported protocols now will send the SNI (server name indicator)
  TLS extension.
- A new mh-format function %(ordinal) has been implemented to output the
  appropriate ordinal suffix for numbers.  Example: "%(num 22)%(ordinal)"
  will output "22nd".
- show and mhl now decode more addresses in header fields.
- Added warning from all programs that read the profile if the profile
  contains a post entry, which is ignored, but does not contain a
  postproc entry.  In other words, if you get this warning and want
  to suppress it, your options include:
  1) Remove your post profile entry.
  2) Make your post profile entry a comment by prepending it with the #:
     comment indicator.
  3) Add a postproc entry that points to the post that you use.  That can
     be viewed with "mhparam postproc".

-----------------
OBSOLETE FEATURES
-----------------

- The MIME content cache functionality has been mostly non-functional since
  the development on nmh, and consequently all of the content caching code
  and related switches (-cache/-rcache/-wcache) have been removed.
- Support for generating and reassembling message/partial messags has been
  removed; it seems that this has been broken since 1.5 and there is very
  little support across MUAs.

-------------------
DEPRECATED FEATURES
-------------------

- The generation and verification of Content-MD5 headers is no longer
  performed.  The -check and -nocheck switches to various nmh programs
  that would control this functionality still exist, but are non-functional
  and will be removed in the next release.

---------
BUG FIXES
---------

- Fixed bcc to work with sendmail/pipe, and better documented that dcc
  doesn't work with it [Bug 55700].
- An -attendee switch has been added to mhical(1), for use when more than one
  (or zero) attendees match a user's mailbox.
- Fixed inc(1) and %(me) function escape to not obey Local-Mailbox profile
  component.
- Fixed source charset in mhfixmsg textcharset verbose output.
